            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Stephen William Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. Despite a modest upbringing, he exhibited an early passion for science. In 1959, at the age of 17, he enrolled at University College, Oxford, where he pursued physics and graduated with a first-class BA degree. He later commenced his graduate studies at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, focusing on general relativity and cosmology. At 21, Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (ALS), a condition that gradually paralyzed him over the years. Despite this, he continued his academic pursuits with unwavering determination.</p>

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>Hawking's contributions to theoretical physics and cosmology are monumental:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Singularity Theorems:</strong> Collaborated with Roger Penrose to develop theorems predicting the universe's beginning as a singularity, supporting the Big Bang theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Hawking Radiation:</strong> Theorized that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near their event horizons, a phenomenon now known as Hawking radiation.</li>
                <li><strong>No-Boundary Proposal:</strong> Proposed that the universe has no boundaries in imaginary time, suggesting a self-contained universe without a singular starting point.</li>
                <li><strong>Top-Down Cosmology:</strong> Suggested that the universe's present state determines its past histories, offering a fresh perspective on cosmological models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond his research, Hawking authored the bestseller <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, aiming to explain complex cosmological concepts to the general public. The book remained on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks, captivating readers worldwide.</p>
